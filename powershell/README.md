# powershell

_"PowerShell is an automation platform and scripting language for Windows and
Windows Server that allows you to simplify the management of your systems.
Unlike other text-based shells, PowerShell harnesses the power of the .NET
Framework, providing rich objects and a massive set of built-in functionality
for taking control of your Windows environments."_
