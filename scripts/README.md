# Scripts

`export PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH`

* `func-depot` - A collection of shell functions (many of which I had forgotten
  about!) in a single script. The file is `source`-ed to expose the functions in
  an interactive bash or zsh shell, but can also be accessed as subcommands (vs
  having to remember the function names.) Also includes a _"help"_ for a quick
  glance of which functions are available.
